== SYNOPSIS

Create an template file, such as README.erb.

In a Ruby script add a erb comment.

  module YourLibrary
    VERSION = "1.0.0" #:erb: VERSION="<%= version %>"
  end

Then run:

  $ erb

All .erb files and all #:erb: inline templates will
be filled in.


== HOW TO INSTALL

Describe your installation procedure here.

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install erb

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  $ tar -xvzf erb-1.0.0.tgz
  $ cd erb-1.0.0.tgz
  $ sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.


== LIMITATIONS

Multiline inline ruby templating is not yet supported.
Would love to implement but need idea on how best to do it.

Also, currently the POM library is not used for accessing meta/
files. This will change once POM properly supports arbitrary metadata.
