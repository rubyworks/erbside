== DESCRIPTION

Till is a simple project-oriented eRuby-based template system
using POM metadata.


== FEATURES

* Easy to use.
* Used eRuby. Easy.
* Uses POM metadata. Easy.
* Templates go where the file goes. Easy.
* Did I mention it was easy?


== SYNOPSIS

Create an template file, such as README.till.

In a Ruby script add a till comment.

  module YourLibrary
    VERSION = "1.0.0" #:till: VERSION="<%= version %>"
  end

Then run:

  $ till

All .till files and all #:till: inline templates will
be filled in.


== HOW TO INSTALL

Describe your installation procedure here.

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install till

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  $ tar -xvzf till-1.0.0.tgz
  $ cd till-1.0.0.tgz
  $ sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.


== LIMITATIONS

Multiline inline ruby templating is not yet supported.
Would love to implement but need idea on how best to do it.

Also, currently the POM library is not used for accessing meta/
files. This will change once POM properly supports arbitrary metadata.
