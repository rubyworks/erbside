= Erbside

== DESCRIPTION

Erbside is a simple inline project-oriented ERB-based template system.
With Erbside it is very easy to do basic templating without the need
for file duplication.

Erbside also provides access to POM metadata, if present.


== FEATURES

* Easy to use.
* Used eRuby. Easy.
* Uses POM metadata. Easy.
* Templates go where the file goes. Easy.
* Did I mention it was easy?


== RESOURCES

* home: http://rubyworks.github.com/erbsie
* docs: http://rubyworks.github.com/erbside/doc/api
* code: http://github.com/rubyworks/erbsie

== SYNOPSIS

In a Ruby script add an ERB comment.

  module YourLibrary
    VERSION = "1.0.0" #:erb: VERSION="<%= version %>"
  end

Then run:

  $ erbside myscript.rb

Unless you use the --force option, Erbside will ask you if
want to overwrite the file. Type y<Enter> and all of the #:erb:
inline templating will be filled in.

To see what erbside would do without anctually writing to the file,
use the -o/--stdout option.

  $ erbside -o myscript.rb


== HOW TO INSTALL

Describe your installation procedure here.

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install erb

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  $ tar -xvzf erb-1.0.0.tgz
  $ cd erb-1.0.0.tgz
  $ sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.


== LIMITATIONS

Multiline inline ruby templating is not yet supported.
Would love to implement but need idea on how best to do it.

Also, currently the POM library is not used for accessing meta/
files. This will change once POM properly supports arbitrary metadata.
