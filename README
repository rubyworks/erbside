== DESCRIPTION

Till is a simple project-oriented eRuby-based template system
using POM metadata.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Easy to use.
* Used eRuby. Easy.
* Uses POM metadata. Easy.
* Templates go where the file goes. Easy.
* Did I mention it was easy?


== SYNOPSIS

Create an template file, such as README.till.

In a Ruby script add a till comment.

  module YourLibrary
    VERSION = "1.0.0" #:till: VERSION="<%= version %>"
  end

Then run:

  $ till

All .till files and all #:till: inline templates will
be filled in.


== HOW TO INSTALL

Describe your installation procedure here.

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  gem install till

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  tar -xvzf till-1.0.0.tgz
  cd till-1.0.0.tgz
  sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.


== LIMITATIONS

* Multiline inline ruby templating is not yet supported.
Would love to implement but need idea on how best to do it.
* POM library is not used for accessing meta/ files. This
should change once POM properly supports arbitrary metadata.
